## Academic purpose

This project is created with the aim of compiling and summarising in easy-to-read
and easy-to-reference terms the ideas and teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses. When
these ideas are summarized or quoted, literally or not, it is in reference to the
ideas published by that organization in their own publications, and not the ideas
of the owners or collaborators of this project.

When these ideas seem to promote discrimination or violence in different forms, this
project is not condoning, reinforcing or supporting these ideas, it is merely referencing
them for academic purposes.

## Quotations

Quotations in these documents are done in good faith and without the aim
of reproducing or breaking the copyright of the owners of the quoted material.

## References and links

When statements reference or link to an external work they do so in the public
domain or using referencing name quotations commonly used by Jehovah's Witnesses
in their own reference publications. These references are here to enable personal
cross-examination by the reader and are made in good faith.

## Copyrighted works

This project does not contain external material copyrighted by other entities.

When this project references external copyrighted material, these references are 
made available for the purposes of cross-examination only. Each
referenced material is owned in their respective jurisdictions by their respective
owners. The collaborators of this project may or may not hold affiliation with the
owners of the copyright of referenced works, but in no way intend to break that
copyright.
