# Modal verbs

<a onclick="history.back()"><< Go Back</a>

This project uses clear statements with modal verbs to
clarify the stance on some daily life areas of Jehovah's
Witnesses. The verbs used denote different degrees of
compulsion or strength in the statements made. This is a
clarification guide:

## Can/could, may/might

These verbs are used in conditional sentences, denoting
a possible effect of an individuals decision, that may not be
mandated through organizational guidelines in all cases.
While the decision may be left to the individual's conscience,
the effects may or may not be enacted depending on local
circumstances.

> **Example**
>
> _"Even when neatly trimmed, choosing to grow a beard
> **may** disqualify you from being appointed for
> privileges of service. Being clean-shaven will not."_
>
> In this statement the verb "may" (replaceable by "can")
> denotes a possibility that is not entirely mandated by the
> organization, but left at the discretion of local bodies
> of elders or local branch office guidelines.

## Shall/Should

This verb denotes a soft obligation or organizational
"push" towards something. When used, it is not referring
to a mandate that must absolutely be followed, and where
failing may have judicial consequences. Instead it refers
to an optional decision left to personal conscience but
that will still have attached some positive or negative
effects in organizational practice.

> **Example**
>
> _"You **should not** pursue higher education."_
>
> In this statement, the use of the verb "should" indicates
> that pursuing higher education is viewed as a decision
> of personal conscience. However, deciding to pursue
> higher education may at times cause the body of elders
> to reconsider privileges of service, to not recommend
> a person for higher privileges of service, or even
> at times to recommend deletion of those privileges.
>
> In this situation a personal decision will not cause
> immediate direct judicial action, but may have attached
> organizational effects for the individual, therefore
> the verb "shall/should" is used.

## Must

This verb denotes obligation towards the individual, and
failing to accept the obligation will have strong
organizational effects in the individual, such as judicial
action or mandated revision of the spiritual standing and
removal of service privileges.

> **Example**
>
> _"You **must not** get a tattoo."_
>
> In this statement, the use of the verb "must" indicates
> that getting a tattoo while associated with the congregation
> will have direct effects on an individual's spiritual
> standing and privileges, and may even have judicial action
> attached to it. Therefore, this is no longer a decision
> left only to one's conscience, but to the organization's
> code of standards.

## Will/would

These verb is used in conditional sentences, denoting
a mandated direct effect caused by an individual's decision,
either affecting directly their status in the congregation,
their eligibility for service privileges or even cause of
[disfellowshipment](terms/disfellowshipment.md) or
[mandated disassociation](terms/disassociation). In positive
conditional sentences, it denotes a preferred good course
of action that may not be mandated, but is highly recommended
as that decision will not have any consequences.

> **Example**
>
> _"Even when neatly trimmed, choosing to grow a beard
> may disqualify you from being appointed for
> privileges of service. Being clean-shaven **will not**."_
>
> In this statement, the use of the verb "will not" indicates
> that while wearing a neatly trimmed beard is a personal decision
> the decision to not wearing it is a _preferred_ option as
> it's the only option that is sure not to carry any
> organizational effects on the individual.
