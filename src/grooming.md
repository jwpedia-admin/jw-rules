## Beards and mustaches

- You should not grow a beard or a mustache.
  - In the case you grow a beard or mustache it should be neatly trimmed ([w16.12 18](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200270710/1/2); [be p. 133](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102001084#h=16)).
  - Even when neatly trimmed, choosing to grow a beard may disqualify you from being appointed for privileges of service. Being clean-shaven will not ([w16.09 21](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200270710/1/0)).
