# Shepherd the Flock of God

<a onclick="history.back()"><< Go Back</a>

The book "Shepherd the Flock of God" (_sfl_) is a book that
Jehovah's Witnesses give exclusively to appointed overseers
(or elders) in their congregations, and that is to be kept
confidential.

This book contains multiple directives on when and how to
handle matters judicially in the congregations, and is
referenced and revisited regularly by letters to the
bodies of elders from the branch offices and branch
representatives (such as circuit and district overseers)
when these visit the congregations and meet with them.

Since this book is only confidentially handed over to
active elders, and it has to be returned if an elder is
deleted, the book is not available as part of the open
library of Watchtower publications (wol.jw.org) and
references to it can only be cross-referenced either with a leaked online copy, or asking a well-meaning elder in
your closest congregation for confirmation. Even if the
elder may not show you that book, he may confirm that the
statements made in this project about Jehovah's Witness
practice are correct.
